# etch-a-sketch

Check it out: https://yogramming.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

A website which allows the user to draw something on the screen, sort of a etch a sketch but this time digitally. This project is made as a part of an assignment under  an open-source bootcamp called The Odin Project. Usage of flexbox and DOM manipulation are the major thing which is practiced in this project. This is purely meant to showcase this very basic skill that I have recently learnt. Thank you for reading it.
